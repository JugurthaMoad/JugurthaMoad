<h2>Bonjour :blush:,</h2>
My name is Jugurtha Moad, and I am <span className="tech">front-end</span> developer with an interest in back-end development based in France.
<br /><br/>
When I am not busy building innovative apps and websites, you can find me exploring the beautiful French countryside on my bike, or curled up with a good book on personal development. 
As a musician, I also enjoy playing guitar to relax and unwind. 
<br />
<br />
My love of personal development and music has taught me the importance of creativity, communication, and collaboration - qualities that I bring to every project I work on.
